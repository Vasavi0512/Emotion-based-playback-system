# Emotion-based-playback-system
Welcome to the Emotion-based-playback-system wiki!
The code for cnn is implemented and because on more number of images the model got overfitted at that time the accuracy we got was 45% and then we reduced the images in dataset around 15000 images are there in this dataset with only 3 emotions happy, sad, neutral and we got the accuracy of 75%.
